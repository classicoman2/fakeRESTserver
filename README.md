# fakeRESTserver

This is a fake rest server that is accessible here: http://my-json-server.typicode.com/classicoman2/fakeRESTserver

How I created this fake Rest Server,

1. Creating the file `db.json` in this repository
2. Get instantly a fake server accessing the url `"my-json-server.typicode.com/" + myusename + myreponame`

More about it in https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide.html

Use it for _GET_ operations. _PUT_, _POST_ and _DELETE_ are not persistent.
